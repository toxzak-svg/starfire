Self-Model: Learn stable editing policy

Based on research RNN architecture from minimal_self_model/models/self_model.py
Learns to generate edits that keep the system stable.

    Self-Model learns its own editing policy.
    
    Architecture mirrors research RNN:
    - Input: Sequence of (latent_state, edit) pairs
    - RNN: Learn temporal dependencies in edit history
    - Output: Next edit that maintains stability
    
    Key insight from research: Self-model-first is more stable than world-model-first
    because it learns to self-correct rather than just predict.
