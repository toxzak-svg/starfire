Uses Jacobian spectral analysis and perturbation return rate to ensure safe edits.

    """
    Monitor stability of edit policy using research-validated metrics.
    
    Two key metrics from research:
    1. Spectral Radius: σ_max < 1 means self-correcting (stable)
    2. Perturbation Return Rate: negative means converging (error recovery)
