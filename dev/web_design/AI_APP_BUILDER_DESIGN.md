# AI App Builder Architecture: Self-Model + World-Model Control System

**Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Status:** Research → Product Design Translation

---

## Executive Summary

This document translates the **Minimal Self-Model First** research architecture into a production AI app builder. Unlike Retool/WeWeb (LLM-as-generator), this system uses learned dynamics to provide **outcome-level guarantees** during app evolution.

### Core Innovation

```
Traditional AI Builders:   LLM → Code → Human Verify → Deploy
Our Architecture:          User Intent → World-Model Prediction → Self-Model Policy → Safe Edit Sequence → Auto-Verify → Deploy
```

**Key differentiator:** The system learns from thousands of app evolution trajectories to predict outcomes and maintain stability, rather than generating code from scratch each time.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Two-Model System

#### World-Model (VAE-based)
**Role:** Learns the latent structure of "app states" and how changes propagate

```python
# Conceptual mapping from research to production
class AppWorldModel:
    """
    Research: VAE(observation) → latent → reconstructed observation
    Production: VAE(app_snapshot) → latent_state → predicted_next_state
    """
    
    # Input: App snapshot vector
    app_snapshot = {
        'schema_embedding': [0.2, 0.5, ...],      # DB schema structure
        'endpoint_graph': [0.1, 0.8, ...],        # API endpoint dependencies
        'test_coverage': [0.9, 0.3, ...],         # Test suite state
        'auth_surface': [0.4, 0.6, ...],          # Authentication points
        'performance_metrics': [120ms, 50req/s],   # Runtime characteristics
    }
    
    # Latent space: ~16-32 dimensions capture app "health" and "complexity"
    z = encode(app_snapshot)  # [0.3, -0.1, 0.8, ...]
    
    # World-model predicts: "If I apply edit E, what's the new state?"
    z_next = transition(z, edit_vector)
    app_snapshot_predicted = decode(z_next)
```

**Trained on:**
- 10,000+ app evolution trajectories from real codebases
- Schema migrations → test outcomes
- New endpoints → auth requirements
- Refactoring → performance impact

#### Self-Model (RNN-based)
**Role:** Learns its own editing policy to keep the system in stable regions

```python
# Conceptual mapping from research to production
class AppSelfModel:
    """
    Research: RNN predicts next state of itself given current state
    Production: RNN predicts next optimal edit given current app state + edit history
    """
    
    # Input: Sequence of (app_state, edit) pairs
    edit_history = [
        (app_state_0, "add_column_users_email"),
        (app_state_1, "update_auth_middleware"),
        (app_state_2, "add_test_email_validation"),
    ]
    
    # Self-model predicts: "What edit should I make next to stay stable?"
    next_edit, confidence = self_model(edit_history)
    # Output: ("add_index_users_email", 0.92)
```

**Trained on:**
- Its own past editing behavior
- Which edit sequences led to stable outcomes
- Which sequences broke tests, auth, or performance

## 2. Research → Production Mapping

### 2.1 State Space Translation

| Research Domain | App Builder Domain |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Time series observation | App state snapshot |
| Next-step prediction | Next edit outcome |
| Rollout divergence | Test/build failure cascade |
| Spectral radius | Edit policy stability |
| Perturbation return | Error recovery capability |

### 2.2 Key Research Findings → Product Features

#### Finding 1: Self-Model-First Wins on Stability
**From [results/probe_ablation.md](results/probe_ablation.md):** Self-model consistently shows better spectral radius and perturbation return across all configurations.

**Product Translation:**
- **Editor-first architecture**: Train the edit policy model first on successful app evolutions
- **Then** add world-model for complex multi-step planning
- **Result:** More stable incremental edits, fewer rollbacks

#### Finding 2: Low Spectral Radius = Stable Dynamics
**From [stability_analysis/jacobian_spectral.py](stability_analysis/jacobian_spectral.py):** Systems with spectral radius < 1 self-correct after perturbations.

**Product Translation:**
- **Edit policy monitoring**: Track spectral radius of the editing RNN
- **If σ_max > 1:** System is making increasingly risky edits → pause and request human review
- **If σ_max < 1:** System is self-correcting → allow autonomous edits

#### Finding 3: Perturbation Return Rate Predicts Recovery
**From [stability_analysis/perturbation_return.py](stability_analysis/perturbation_return.py):** Negative return rate means system returns to equilibrium after random perturbations.

**Product Translation:**
- **Error recovery testing**: After each edit, inject small random changes and measure convergence
- **If system converges:** Edit was in a stable region → safe to proceed
- **If system diverges:** Edit destabilized the app → auto-rollback and try alternative

```

### 3.2 Runtime Architecture

```
User Request: "Add email verification to user signup"

Step 1: Intent Parsing (Standard LLM)
├── Extract structured intent: {feature: "email_verification", scope: "user_signup"}
└── Generate candidate edits: [E1, E2, E3, ...]

Step 2: World-Model Prediction (Novel)
├── Current app state → latent z_current
├── For each edit E_i:
│   ├── z_next = transition(z_current, E_i)
│   ├── predicted_tests = decode_tests(z_next)
│   ├── predicted_auth = decode_auth(z_next)
│   └── predicted_performance = decode_perf(z_next)
├── Filter edits: Keep only E where predicted_tests = PASS
└── Result: [E1, E3] pass predictions, E2 would break 2 tests

Step 3: Self-Model Policy Selection (Novel)
├── Edit history: [edit_-5, ..., edit_-1]
├── For each candidate E in [E1, E3]:
│   ├── Compute: stability_score = self_model([...history, E])
│   └── stability_score = f(spectral_radius, perturbation_return)
├── Select: E* = argmax(stability_score)
└── Result: E1 has best stability (0.89), choose E1

Step 4: Execute with Monitoring
├── Apply edit E1
├── Run tests → 98% pass (vs 95% predicted) ✓
├── Measure spectral radius of new state → 0.72 (stable) ✓
├── Inject perturbation → system converges in 3 steps ✓
└── **Commit and mark as success**

Step 5: Learn from Outcome
├── True outcome: (z_current, E1) → (z_new, tests=98%, perf=+5ms)
├── Update world-model: Refine transition prediction
└── Update self-model: Reinforce this edit as good policy
```

## 7. Technical Challenges

### 7.1 State Representation

## 9. Conclusion

The research has proven the viability of **self-model + world-model architectures for stable sequential prediction** in timeseries domains. Key findings:

1. **Self-model-first is more stable** (lower spectral radius, better perturbation return)
2. **Learned dynamics outperform hand-coded rules** (VAE latent transitions are data-driven)
3. **Stability metrics predict long-term behavior** (spectral radius correlates with rollout divergence)

These directly transfer to the app builder domain:
- **Self-model-first editing policies** → stable incremental development
- **World-model predictions** → catch breaking changes before commit
- **Stability monitoring** → autonomous error recovery

**The gap between Retool/WeWeb and us is not "more AI"—it's AI arranged as a control system with explicit dynamics models and outcome guarantees.**
